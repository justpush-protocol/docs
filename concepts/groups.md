# What are Groups?

A `Group` is anyone who activates themselves as a service on the protocol to send notifications to its users.

Any service that wants to send notifications to their users can create a `Group.`Typically dApps in the Tron ecosystem will create a `Group` to send notifications to their users.&#x20;

The creation of a group happens on-chain. A channel can have one `owner` and multiple `notifiers`.

A successfully created `Group` is capable of send notifications to its subscribers directly tied to their wallet address.  Any wallet address can become a `subscriber` of the Group by opting in.

> Ideally, in the future there will be staking requirement to create groups so the protocol is not congested with spam groups. But as of right now, there is no such requirement.
